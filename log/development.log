NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

In order to run the set, I had to change my communication style with my directing team in order to do the work of 3 people behind the camera while acting my role when the camera is rolling. Normally, a film set would have a script manager, a UPM, and an Assistant Director hitting the scenes, setting up blocking and camera frames, and controlling the shooting schedule. The best chance an indie producer has at this is to be the script manager and use their authority. That way they can bounce back and forth between following the script with the needs of the set without any other individual's input on the matter. A writer has the best chance at this also due to knowing the script from heart for the management of the set and also their character's performance becoming second nature."}, "commit"=>"submit", "id"=>"reaaf"}

It is almost shocking the equivocacy of the organization and facilities of an outfit's leader's psyche and the span of existence of said leader's outfit. Often, if studied in minute detail the collapse of a leader's organization explains issues in the leader's judgment, personal boundaries, their shake-out of self-development from their background and its impact on the subject, and thousands of other subtopics grouped in 50-100 chapters in psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive producing an indie movie is the single most fun experience I never want to have again in life. In order to run the set, I had to change my communication style with my directing team in order to do the work of 3 people behind the camera while acting my role when the camera is rolling. Normally, a film set would have a script manager, a UPM, and an Assistant Director hitting the scenes, setting up blocking and camera frames, and controlling the shooting schedule. The best chance an indie producer has at this is to be the script manager and use their authority. That way they can bounce back and forth between following the script with the needs of the set without any other individual's input on the matter. A writer has the best chance at this also due to knowing the script from heart for the management of the set and also their character's performance becoming second nature."], ["status", 1], ["updated_at", "2019-01-06 01:40:12.515464"], ["id", 4]]
