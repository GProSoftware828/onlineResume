        "My experience includes working on and submitting Basecamp to-do tasks directly to the client and designing software based on multi-langauge possibilities. I routinely engage in several blog communities and attend programming events. My unique background coming from fictional publishing projects has made me a mid-level programmer with the skillsets of a senior level programmer."
