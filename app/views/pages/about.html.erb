        "I am a diversified computer programmer and knowledgable software developer. In three years I have covered the spectrum of deeply researching and applying the languages of website applications and computing languages such as C++ in professional projects. My experience includes working on and submitting Basecamp to-do tasks directly to the client. I routinely engage in several blog communities and attend programming events. My unique background coming from fictional writing publishing projects has made me a mid-level programmer with the skillsets of a senior level programmer- perfect for joining any robust start-up or mid-level position. I also have strong debugging and testing skills for the backend."
